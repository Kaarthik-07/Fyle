The Fyle Web Development Internship Challenge is a project where I designed a website for tax calculation based on user input. The project involved implementing a tax calculation algorithm, validating user input, and displaying results in a modal window. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
